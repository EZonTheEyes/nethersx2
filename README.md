# Installation & Usage

Please see the Readme's included with the releases, along with the video guide bellow, on how to install and use this iteration for yourself.

# Bios Claim Tool for PS2 and PS1 Bios

Thanks to this tool, it is now possible to easily obtain a PS2 (and PS1) BIOS from PS3 Firmware without the need to obtain one from a PS2 Console through an easy to execute plugin for RPCS3, named Firmware BIOS Claim. This means all you would need to play a PS2 game legally is access to a computer.
